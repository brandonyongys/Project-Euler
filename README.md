# Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

I have managed to solve some of the hundreds of interesting problems and my solutions are deposited here for safekeeping and sharing with others. Any feedback and comments on my solutions are welcomed!
